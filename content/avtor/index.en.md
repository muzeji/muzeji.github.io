1977 I graduated History of Art on the University in Ljubljana, Slovenia; 1995 finished Master of Art in museology on Zagreb University, Croatia, Department of Information Sciences. As senior museum counseller I headed the Educational Service of the City Museum and Galleries in Ljubljana, Slovenia. From 1991 to 2011 I was the chairman of Museoforums – a sort of annual professional meetings of slovenian museum people with the participation of international experts discussing different actual themes concerning the future development of museums. As one of the first  museum visitor researcher in Slovenia I' ve been active for 15 years in evaluating museum public programms and carrying on visitor studies and market analysis. Since 1995 I've been included in many exhibition teams inside the City museum and as a consultant in some other slovenian museums. I carried on  preliminary and summative exhibition evaluations in national museums (Slovenian Etnographical Museum, National Museum of Slovenia and Slovenian Museum for Recent History) and Regional Museum in Celje, I've provided workshops and consultancy on visitor and market research, on exhibition interpretation.
 
As the member of the Visitor Study Group in GB, I've always stressed the importance of the visitor access and participation in museum exhibitions, programms and activities.
